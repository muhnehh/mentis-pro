# MentisPro - Real-time Cognitive Load Monitoring

A sophisticated React application that uses TensorFlow.js to monitor and analyze cognitive load in real-time. The system uses advanced machine learning techniques to process multiple input signals and provide comprehensive cognitive state analysis.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous analysis of user's cognitive state
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Tracks multiple metrics including:
  - Cognitive Load
  - Attention Level
  - Stress Level
  - Focus Quality
  - Mental Fatigue
  - Learning Progress
  - Workload Intensity

- **Advanced ML Model**: Uses TensorFlow.js with:
  - Multi-layer neural network
  - Batch normalization
  - Dropout layers for regularization
  - Advanced optimizer configuration

- **Sophisticated Sensor Data Processing**:
  - Eye movement tracking
  - Head position monitoring
  - Keyboard activity analysis
  - Time-based fatigue modeling

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript 4
- TensorFlow.js 4.22
- Recharts for visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
